It is developed by [Move Lab @ UC Santa Barbara](https://move.geog.ucsb.edu/) and designed to be accessible and easily usable for scientists without extensive prior experience with programming, GIS software, or custom data visualization tools. The intuitive design focuses on a simple interface for scientists to apply spatial data visualization techniques, giving ecologists and biologists of all backgrounds the power to visualize complicated spatial patterns.
